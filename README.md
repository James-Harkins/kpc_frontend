# KPC - Front End 

<img width="698" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93609855/217671789-38522ce8-3e9d-4c5a-8770-867ffbb4b97e.png">

## Overview 

KPC is an app used for management of the world's most glorious golf outing, the Kitchen Pass Classic, which I have had the good fortune of attending with my Father and all of his best buddies since I was a Senior in High School, and which all of my best buddies have begun attending since around the same time. 

This is the documentation for the Front End app, written on ReactJS (Version 18.2.0). It fetches data from the [Back End API](https://github.com/James-Harkins/kpc_backend) and allows users to register, log in, view the previous trips they have attended and their costs, as well as register for the next upcoming trip. Future goals for the project will be discussed at the end of this document.
